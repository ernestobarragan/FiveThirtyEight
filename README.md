###Why I chose this question

I chose this question because I wanted to understand how people feel about being asked to switch seats on a plane so families can sit together. The dataset was about flight etiquette, and I thought this was a really interesting topic, especially now that a lot of airlines charge extra for certain seats.

###What I found interesting

The results were honestly surprising. I expected more people to say it was rude, but most didnâ€™t seem to have an issue with it. It made me realize that a lot of people are more understanding than I thought when it comes to situations like this.

###What this chart shows

This chart shows how 805 people felt about being asked to switch seats. It breaks down how many thought it was very rude, somewhat rude, or not rude at all. It really highlights how accepting people can be when it comes to making space for families on a flight.
